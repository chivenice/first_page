   <p>Yeah we don't wanna do anything to scare your children
      That's the last thing we wanna do
      We don't wanna scared anybody.
    </p>

    <p>Never said it was fair, but still I never knew fear 
       Not in a million years could you tell me that I'l be here
       I just hopped off that lear, my life on another tier
       Lifting glasses for cheers, keep that hating out my ear
       From country living to country skipping. thid would drive you crazy
       Check the rate that they pay me
