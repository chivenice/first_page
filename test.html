    <h2>Walk The Line - Iggy Azalea</h2>
   <p1>Yeah we don't wanna do anything to scare your children
      That's the last thing we wanna do
      We don't wanna scared anybody.
    </p1>

     <br>

    <p2>Never said it was fair, but still I never knew fear 
       Not in a million years could you tell me that I'l be here
       I just hopped off that lear, my life on another tier
       Lifting glasses for cheers, keep that hating out my ear
       From country living to country skipping. thid would drive you crazy
       Check the rate that they pay me
    </p2>

     <br>

    <p3>Money never a maybe, but never forgot my roots
       I heard that the top is lonely, I wonder if it's the truth
       So I'm just climbing, paid off rhyming, now I'm shining, could be blinding
       Ain't too much real left but right here is where you could find it
    </p3>
    
    <br>

   <p4>This that new classic, ain't this what you needed?
   I'm what amazing look like, now recognize it when you see it<br><br><br><br>
   Not where I wanna be, but I'm far from home
   Just tryna make it on my own
   <u>And unless destiny calls, I don't answer phones</u>
   <i><strong>This the line and I walk alone</strong></i><br></p4>
   <p5>Ain't no going back now
   Don't know where I'm at now
   Ain't no going back now
